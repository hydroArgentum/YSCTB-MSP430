            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 27, 2017</a></p>

            <p>After much struggling and procrastinating, I’m finally getting this blog post out. I’m currently planning to create some small hardware projects that are probably too simple to be considered really serious projects, but I seek to continue learning and practicing embedded engineering and break out those microcontrollers that I’ve been hiding.</p>
            <p>What I am planning to do is to create a system where I detect the amount of light entering my living room to determine whether or not I should open or close my blinds. It’s a small thing and I could make the excuse that it’s about efficiently using electricity, but if I really wanted to argue about this, I could argue that buying a light-detecting LED lightbulb is a much better option...</p>
            <p>But I have the necessary materials do make my own (probably inferior) thing and it’s a great learning experience, so I just took that idea and went with it.</p>
            <p>Also, I’m uncreative as f***, as you may have understood by looking at the name of the project. I probably won’t be able to think of some brilliant ideas that everyone would want to replicate, so I’ll take any project that comes to my mind. (That I could feasibly do, with that lack of proper equipment.)</p>
            <p>I’ll use this blog template that I got from Bootstrap to document my work with the project and I’ll archive the blog posts on a Blogger that will be set up later along in the project.</p>
            <p>If you want to see a great project, you should look elsewhere. It’s GitHub, there’s tons of brilliant projects out there.</p>
            <p>You’re still here? Ok... I haven’t thought of what to write next, so you may need to check back later.</p>
            <p>The next objective is to do some more setup; creating the Blogger and testing how I’ll archive the posts on the Blogger page.</p>
